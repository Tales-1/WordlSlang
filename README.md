# Wordl Slang edition (INCOMPLETE)

A project I decided to code 2 months after learning Javascript to test my ability.

Though most of the functions work it is incomplete and requires a few fixes to the code such as:

- an updated library of words to go by
- UI needs to be fixed so it works on all viewports
