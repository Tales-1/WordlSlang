# Wordl Slang edition (INCOMPLETE)

![WordlSlang](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84051594/204838673-8370464d-04d2-4d63-8515-1877626897d5.png)


This is a project I decided to code 2 months after learning JavaScript. It was quite tough but extremely rewarding at the same time given that I did not refer to any tutorials. It is one of my proudest accomplishments as, at the time, I was an amateur with no previous knowledge of building web applications.

## Description:
- Slang words were chosen from "urbandictionary.com" 
- Attempts are stored in local storage for a day and refreshed when there is a new word of the day
- Definition of each word is avaiable after the word is correctly guessed or the player runs out of tries


Though most of the functions work it is incomplete and requires a few fixes to the code such as:

- an updated library of words to go by ** Library now loops through and repeats after 22 days
- ~~UI needs to be fixed so it works on all viewports~~ ** Complete: Update: UI still buggy 14/03/2023, not accessible on all viewports
